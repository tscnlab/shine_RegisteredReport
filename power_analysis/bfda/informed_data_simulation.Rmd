# Using data from Fernandez-Alonso et al (2025) to create set of plasuible distribution values for our model

Model of interest to test CH3a:
melatonin suppression = E2 levels + P4 levels + (E2 | PID) + (P4 | PID), where E2 = estradiol levels, P4 = progesterone levels, and PID = participant ID.

We first import melatonin suppression data to get

1. Define a list of potential distribution for intercept 
2. Define a list of potential distribution for the slope of E2 (first predictor) - mean and SD, with SD = 10% of the mean
3. Define a list of potential distribution for the slope of P4 (second predictor) - mean and SD, with SD = 10% of the mean
4. Define a range for the values of E2 and P4
5. Define noise distribution with mean 0 and SD 5
6. For each combination of the distribution and values of E2 and P4, create fake data y (i.e. melatonin suppression) for that model - for the same combination do this 100 times, meaning for each combination you get 100 values of y
7. Calculate the mean and SD of the fake data of this one y 
8. Compare to Maydel's data and re-iterate - define a criterion for what "good" and "bad" combinations of the parameter distributions (e.g. anything that is + or - 20% away fro mean of Maydel's data)

```{r}
y = intercept + slope1*E2 + slope2*P4 + noise
```

## Define variables specified above
```{r}
intercept_mean_list <- list(1, 10, 100)
e2_slope_mean_list <- list(0.1, 1, 10)
p4_slope_mean_list <- list(0.1, 1, 10)
e2_min_value <- 0.5
e2_max_value <- 150
p4_min_value <- 0.5
p4_max_value <- 150
num_simulations <- 100

maydel_mean <- 50
maydel_sd <- 10
```

## Create for loop
